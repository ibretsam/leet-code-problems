221. Maximal Square
Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and 
return its area.

Example 1:
Input: matrix = 
[
	["1","0","1","0","0"],
	["1","0","1","1","1"],
	["1","1","1","1","1"],
	["1","0","0","1","0"]
]
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: matrix = 
[
	["0","1"],
	["1","0"]
]
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
 
Constraints:
m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 300
matrix[i][j] is '0' or '1'.
